## Before Machine Learning

<div class="fragment">
$$ a^2 = b^2 + c^2 $$
</div>

<div class="fragment">
$$ distance = speed * time $$
</div>

<div class="fragment">
$$ CTR = 100 (clicks / views) $$
</div>

<div class="fragment" style="font-size: 2em">
<hr />
$$ y = f(x) $$
</div>

Note:
- Pythagoras 500BC
- SDT 17th Century, Galileo?
- Virality, number of invites * conversion rate. > 1 and you're growing exponentially

## What is `f` for...

<div class="fragment">
$$ Artist = f(Motorhead, Metallica) $$
</div>

<div class="fragment">
$$ Spam = f(Email) $$
</div>

<div class="fragment">
$$ Italian = f(English) $$
</div>

Note:
- IBM researcher "Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recognizer goes up"
- The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Data - 2010 paper

## What's Different?

| First | Second |
|:-----:|:------:|
| Sides of a Triangle | Music recommendation |
| Speed, Distance, Time | Spam Detection     |
| Click-Through Rate    | Translation          |

Note:
First Group
- Relatively simple relationships
- There's a right answer
- Answer stays the same over time

Second Group
- Complicated rules
- Different answers for different contexts (places, people)
- May be constantly changing, need to continually update `f`

## Machine Learning is...

Note:
- Andrew Ng is one of the founders of Coursera and wrote its first machine learning course

## Machine Learning is...

`$$ f = data + computers $$`

Note:
- Traditional programming involves humans writing rules, like the first examples
- Machine learning applies computational power to data to derive rules from data
