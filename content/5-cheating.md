## So cheat!

Note:
 - Cognitive services
 - Pre-built models
 - My example
 - Products build around the workflow to help you get data, train, evaluate, deploy

## Canned Models as a Service

- Images
- Videos
- Translation
- Transcription
- Dialogue
- ...more and growing

Note:
- known as AI Services, Cognitive Services
- Image processing eg. find faces, transcribe text, moderation, handwriting
- Videos - detect objects, landmarks 
- Translation - from one language to another
- Transcription - speech to text
- Don't have to find and analyse your own data
- Don't have to figure out how to train and evaluate
- Don't have to operationalise
- Avoid many of the costs and risks
- On-Prem - Machine Box

## Example: Google Image API

Note:
- detected gloves in the image
- also can detect logos, colour schemes

## Care Needed

Note:
- canned models aren't perfect
- can still carry unwanted biases in the data
- need to design well to avoid creepiness
