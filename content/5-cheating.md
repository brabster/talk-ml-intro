 - Cognitive services
 - Pre-built models
 - My example
 - Products build around the workflow to help you get data, train, evaluate, deploy

## Canned Models as a Service

- Images
- Videos
- Translation
- Transcription
- Dialogue
- ...more and growing

Note:
 - known as AI Services, Cognitive Services
 - Image processing eg. find faces, transcribe text, moderation, handwriting
 - Videos - detect objects, landmarks 
 - Translation - from one language to another
 - Transcription - speech to text
 - Don't have to find and analyse your own data
 - Don't have to figure out how to train and evaluate
 - Don't have to operationalise
 - Avoid many of the costs and risks

## Care Needed

Note:
 - canned models aren't perfect
 - can still carry unwanted biases in the data
 - need to design well to avoid creepiness
